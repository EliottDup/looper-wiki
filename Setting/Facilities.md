#facilities #wip
# Type
Multiple possibilities:
1. Underground
2. Semi-underground (buried in a mountain)
3. Undersea

Also:
1. Multiple connected facilities
2. Single big facility

If there are multiple connected facilities different construction locations are possible, (eg. Research undersea & rest above ground).

# Aesthetics
The "Levels" that the robot is released into are very clean, controlled environments, kind of like the levels in the "Karlson" Trailer, also like the tutorial in Titanfall 2. Outside of the "Testing Chambers", The lab is split up into multiple sections: [[#Assembly]], [[#Research]], [[#Testing]], [[#Living Quarters]] and maybe [[#Life Support]] if on [[Planet|another planet]].

## Sections
Assembly is comprised of multiple assembly lines, going from an input (potential spaceport or something).
The assembly lines build up the common enemies/robots. There are many assembly lines throughout the facility.

## Research
Research is closely knit to [[#Testing]] and [[#Assembly]]. Research is also very dependant on lore, location and Facility type.

## Testing
The testing sections themselves are also split into multiple sections: Automated Testing and Manual Testing (AT & MT).

### Automated Testing
Automated Testing is reminiscent of the maps in Portal and Portal 2, with clean chambers, cameras and observation windows to enable scientists to monitor everything.
Automated Testing is reserved for testing of fully automated robots and machines, where they are let loose and staff cannot enter during tests, due to the danger.

### Manual Testing
Manual Testing is quite like Automated Testing, but slightly less clean, because it is almost constantly in use by scientists and technicians. Tests are directed either in large rooms or in a specific section with many smaller rooms. Each room is made to be resistant to almost everything or keep anything inside, due to the possibly dangerous experimental tests.

### Outside Testing Chambers
Outside of the testing chambers, the halls kind of look like the inside of a spaceship, where each hall/wall is actually used and serves a function. Either storage, life support or ventilation (Maybe something else as well).s

## Living Quarters
