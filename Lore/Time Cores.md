#time-core #temporal-stabilizer #wip #core-potency 
A strange artefact that does not travel through time linearly, arising interest from an unknown organization later renamed to [[Looper]].

# Appearance
## Unstable
 They are also a deadly hazard to anything unlucky enough to come in contact with them, violently ripping whatever touched it to shreds, the resulting motion often pulling on the rest of the object, thus bringing it closer to the Core. Multiple early researchers have lost feet or entire legs accidentally walking into uncontained cores. It has happened more than once for those operating the Temporal Stabilizers to have a finger knocked off.

## Stable
Stabilized Cores have lost their protective shell and all have exactly the same shape, despite size differences, their shapes are "perfectly" matched to each other. They take the shape of a tall octahedron, having the distance to two opposing vertices doubled, making two tall pyramids attached, each of these pyramids have half of their height cut off and rotated 45 degrees.
The importance of this form is not understood and there are no active theories on what they might mean.
# Unstable Cores
## General Description
Unstable Cores are round and around 2-3 cm in size, they "jitter" around a specific location in four-dimensional space at the speed of light, amassing an indestructible shield of ultraheavy metals around themselves. Stabilizing them requires a [[Core Containment#Temporal Stabilizers|Temporal Stabilizer]].

## Hazards
Due to their jittering and their shield, unstable Cores can rip through anything unlucky enough to get caught in their path. Violently ripping through any softer tissues, incidents with them are more often than not lethal. survivors of Core vibrations have been lucky enough to get thrown away with the initial blow, without landing on any other unstable Cores and often lose the entire limb. a fairly common type of injury with the Temporal Stabilizer operators is the loss of a finger, which get "bumped" off by the Core without affecting the rest of the body.
One operator reports not have noticed their finger was vaporized while preparing a core for stabilization until a few seconds later.

## Appearance
Unstable cores take on a hyper-spherical appearance, with most being about 2-3 cm in diameter, but due to them jittering near light speeds in the 4th dimension, their shield seems to grow/shrink between their actual radius and completely disappearing. This is nearly impossible to actually observe in person, as their jittering is too fast to register properly.

## Shielding
Unstable Cores built up an impenetrable spherical shield around them. This shield is some sort of amalgamation of ultra-heavy atoms nearly frozen in time because of the Core's ultra-relativistic speed.
### Creation
When the Core (or its shielding) impacts an atom, it has a chance to "hold" the atom, sticking the atom to itself, if an atom on a shield impacts another atom, there is a chance for nuclear fusion to occur, merging both of the atoms together into a heavier one. These heavier atoms however, would break down extremely fast, to see why this does not happen and why the shielding ends up spherical, see [[#Sustenance]].
### Sustenance
Due to its jittering at near *c* velocity, the unstable atoms' half-lives are extended to near infinity. As the heavy atoms get further from the Core (the shielding thicker), the relativistic effects weaken, until at some distance, the rate of decay of the outer layer is as fast as the rate at which the shield builds up new material, resulting in a stable, renewing shield.
%% 
Unstable Time Cores are found layered with ultra-heavy metals nearly frozen in time, making extracting these cores impossible to extract through normal means.

These Time Cores slowly build up heavy metals around them, seemingly to protect them from the outside. These layers build up through nuclear fusion, anytime the core hits a particle, this particle is fused into the outer layer. There is a small chance that a particle instead "sticks" to the outer layer, thus beginning the construction of yet another layer. These layers do not grow beyond a certain point, as the further they get from the core, the less they are slowed, which at a certain point allowing for the decay to be equal to the amount of particles amassed, creating an equilibrium.

Since these metals are nearly frozen in time, any energy transferred to them from our reference frame accumulates very fast from their reference frame. Them being nearly frozen in time also means that they decay over nearly infinite periods of time, and makes them impenetrable to all known technology.

The reason these Cores make themselves and their "shields" move slowly through time is because they themselves are constantly moving through the 4th dimension. And like moving close to the speed of light makes you travel slower through time, moving very close to light speed in the 4th dimension would slow down its time.

These cores are also not simply "moving", but more "vibrating" in the 4th dimension, making them stay near our 3d slice, not moving more than multiple plank lengths from their original position.
This implies that there can also be Cores just outside of our 3d slice, which pushes Looper to invest in 4 dimensional "nudging" of Cores into our slice to retrieve more of them from sources. Since the outer shield is also a hypersphere, it is also possible for a Core to be out of our reach, but its shield to be visible.  %%
# Stable Cores
Cores are stabilized by trapping them in our 3d slice using a [[Core Containment#Temporal Stabilizers|Temporal Stabilizer]] to energize the Core. Doing this locks it into our 3d slice, stopping its 4d movement and forcing it to travel through time regularly, also instantly breaking down their shields, as the ultra-heavy elements start to decay at normal rates, in turn revealing the Core.

# Core Potency
Some Cores are more powerful than others, requiring more energy to constrain but less to be guided in the required direction.

Cores of higher Potency are always heavier than their less Potent counterparts. However the difference in mass is nearly negligible, even over immense Potency differences. For example, the most Potent Core found can work for thousands of years uninterrupted, and the least Potent Core could only sustain "warping" for at most close to a millisecond, with their mass differing by only around 0,05%.

# Life Cycle
While it is unknown how Cores are formed, understanding their "life cycle" can help us understand their birth.
While we have no Idea how Cores came to be, there is strong evidence for them having the ability to split or "Separate" into smaller Cores with less Potency, but preserving velocity and direction. The reason that this is believes is that tighter clusters of Cores have been observed to have very similar velocity and movement, this has been observed on every Core Site found.

There is currently no evidence of an inverse action to Separation. (Note that Separation has not yet been confirmed and only has strong evidence for it)

## Theories
There are multiple theories on Cores and their origins, with the most prominent ones listed below. None of these have been either proven or disproven.

Names are #wip
### Descendance
This suggests that Cores are able to Separate, but nothing else. Meaning that all Cores must either come from one or multiple "Original Core(s)". These Original Cores would have unimaginable Potencies. 
If this is the case, the Cores that arrived on Earth are likely from the same Original, as their vibration vectors all point toward the same general direction. (Note: This might also be due to an unknown Alignment phenomenon that might have occurred a long time ago)
Whether there would have been only one or multiple Originals is unknown.

### Full Cycle
This theory suggests that cores can both Separate and Assimilate, theorizing that Cores are the most stable at the sizes that have been found on Earth. While this no longer necessitates any Original Cores, it allows for the possibility that an Original was created and then broke down into the smaller parts we have on Earth.

### Passage
This theory, while seemingly very outlandish, has yet to be be disproven and is taken seriously by the physicists at Looper. Building upon the idea of both the Big Bang and the Big Crunch. Theorizing that Time Cores can pass through the Big Crunch and survive the Big Bang, essentially traversing to a new universe, and split while doing so. The implications of this would be that many universes ago, the Originals were created/formed, and have persisted/endured through many entire universes, their beginning, and their ends.
