these are some **VERY** early ideas, and the whole project has since changed in direction. These were made before I started this wiki. And at some point I looked at ChatGPT to help me write out my ideas some more.

in chronological order these are (if I remember correctly):
- [[My story idea]]
- [[AI story ideas]]
- [[story V2]]

But even before [[My story idea|the first ideas]], this began as a school project, of which the only remaining footage is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8n3AcX9cvU), recorded on my shitty little laptop (and my name not even spelled correctly), it was just a simple game very inspired by the movie Tenet and their whole time reversal shenanigans, I wanted to make my dream game, combining Tenet and high-speed fps games like Titanfall 2 and Karlson. And I have to say, it was not very impressive.
Then, fast forward half a year later, my laptop's SSD broke (whoops), and the game was lost (I learned the hard way that I should use version control software and github...). But after a while, I get a bunch of ideas for Looper and how I could make a story that makes sense. So I write some stuff down, and eventually make [[My story idea]], which I would then try to improve by using chatgpt. I think that [[story V2]] was kind of a temporary script, because I think that i went back to improve [[My story idea]] afterward, so that is the final version of the story. 

However, now, rereading what I wrote, I didn't like it that much, it all just felt clumsy. So I decided that I needed to know more about the world around Looper, understand how it all works before trying to make a story out of it.

Now this has become more of a worldbuilding project than anything for a specific game,
