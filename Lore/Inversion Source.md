# Time Cores
This strange artifact found from a [[#Source|source]] #wip does not travel through time linearly, arising interest from an unknown organization later renamed to Looper.

## Unstable Cores
Unstable Time Cores are found layered with Ultraheavy metals nearly frozen in time, making extracting these cores almost impossible to extract.

These Time Cores slowly build up heavy metals around them, seemingly to protect them from the outside. These layers build up through nuclear fusion, anytime the core hits a particle, this particle is fused into the outer layer. There is a small chance that a particle instead "sticks" to the outer layer, thus beginning the construction of yet another layer. These layers do not grow beyond a certain point, as they get further from the core, they are slowed less, allowing for the decay to be equal to the amount of particles amassed, creating an equilibrium.

Since these metals are nearly frozen in time, any energy transferred to them from our reference frame accumulates very fast from their reference frame. Them being nearly frozen in time also means that they decay over much nearly infinite periods of time, and makes them impenetrable.

The reason these Cores make themselves and their "shields" move slowly through time is because they themselves are constantly moving through the 4th dimension. And like moving close to the speed of light makes you travel slower through time, moving very close to light speed in the 4th dimension would slow down its time.

These cores are also not simply "moving", but more "vibrating" in the 4th dimension, making them stay near our 3d slice, not moving more than multiple plank lengths from their original position.
This implies that there can also be Cores just outside of our 3D slice, which pushes Looper to invest in 4 dimensional "nudging" of Cores into our slice to retrieve more of them from sources. Since the outer shield is also a hypersphere, it is also possible for a Core to be out of our reach, but its shield to be visible. 
## Stable Cores
Cores are stabilized by trapping them in our 3d slice using a [[#Temporal Stabilizers|Temporal Stabilizer]] to energize the Core, this process is very time consuming as time around the Core is slowed down so much that energy takes a while to get to the core. Doing this locks it into our 3d slice, stopping its 4d movement and makes it travel through time regularly, also instantly breaking down their shields, revealing the Core.

## Core Potency
For yet-to-be uncovered reasons, some Cores are more powerful than others, requiring more energy to constrain but less to be guided in the required direction.

It is theorized that Cores can "Separate", splitting into multiple Cores with lower Potency. While this has never been recorded, it is strongly hinted at by the fact that the nearer Cores are found to each other, the more similar their movements are. If this "Separation" is a real phenomenon, it must mean one of two things: there either was once a gigantic Core, from which all Cores "Descend", or there is a yet to be proven "Core Cycle", which would allow weaker Cores to somehow form stronger Cores together.

Core Potency, like all energy in the universe, does not seem to disappear, this reinforces the first theory, the one of the "Super Core", that like energy, Core potency is spread throughout the universe overtime.

# Core Containment
The only known way to Stabilize a core is by the use of a Temporal Stabilizer. These allow for complete control of a Core's power. But there is an alternative: Core Containers.
## Temporal Stabilizers
Temporal Stabilizers (TS for short) are experimental machines that can "trap" a Time Core in a 4d slice, allowing its power to be harnessed by creating a 4d field that constrains any time core that enters it to its (the TS) 3d slice.

While Temporal Stabilizers are very large and cumbersome to work with, they allow for complete control of the Core's power. Allowing Looper to use them to freely accelerate/decelerate through time and space in any direction. The size constraint only makes them them suitable for large static constructions like Interdimensional Stations ( #wip ). 

## Core Containers
These small Containers are slightly thicker than a regular pen, but comparable in length. Holding the Time Core in the center, these small contraptions are much more constrained in their abilities. Depending on the Potency of the Core, they allow for shorter changes in the passage of time, usually ranging from months to years with the average Core, with some of the strongest Cores however, this can be extended to millennia, with the weakest, reduced to seconds. 

These Containers however are still limited in what they can achieve, able to do the simplest of tasks like inverting or speeding up the user's time frame (note that the term *user* refers here to whatever machine it powers).
