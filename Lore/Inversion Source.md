# Time Cores
This strange artifact found from a [[#Source|source]] does not travel through time linearly, arising interest from an unknown organization later renamed to Looper.

## Unstable Cores
Unstable Time Cores are found layered with Ultraheavy metals nearly frozen in time, making extracting these cores almost impossible to extract.

These Time Cores slowly build up heavy metals around them, seemingly to protect them from the outside. These layers build up through nuclear fusion, anytime the core hits a particle, this particle is fused into the outer layer. There is a small chance that a particle instead "sticks" to the outer layer, thus beginning the construction of yet another layer. These layers do not grow beyond a certain point, as they get further from the core, they are slowed less, allowing for the decay to be equal to the amount of particles amassed, creating an equilibrium.

Since these metals are nearly frozen in time, any energy transferred to them from our reference frame accumulates very fast from their reference frame, allowing them to heat up to incredible temperatures. Them being nearly frozen in time also means that they do not decay at normal rates, and makes them impenetrable.

The reason these Cores make themselves and their "shields" move slowly through time is because they themselves are constantly moving through the 4th dimension. And like moving close to the speed of light makes you travel slower through time, moving very close to light speed in the 4th dimension would slow down its time.

These cores are also not simply "moving", but more "vibrating" in the 4th dimension, making them stay near our 3d slice, not moving more than multiple plank lengths from their original position.
This implies that there can also be Cores just outside of our 3D slice, which pushes Looper to invest in 4 dimensional "nudging" of Cores into our slice to retrieve more of them from sources. Since the outer shield is also a hypersphere, it is also possible for a Core to be out of our reach, but its shield to be visible. 
## Stable Cores
Cores are stabilized by trapping them in our 3d slice using a [[#Temporal Stabilizers|Temporal Stabilizer]] to energize the Core, this process is very time consuming as time around the Core is slowed down so much that energy takes a while to get to the core. Doing this locks it into our 3d slice, stopping its 4d movement and makes it travel through time regularly, also instantly breaking down their shields, revealing the Core.
## Temporal Stabilizers
Temporal Stabilizers(TS for short) are experimental machines that can "trap" a Time Core in a 4d slice, allowing its power to be harnessed by creating a 4d field that constrains any time core that enters it to its(the TS) 3d slice.

# Source
Why was Looper founded? Where did we find these Time Cores?

Multiple Possibilities:
1. Comet
2. Planet Exploration
3. Deeper digs in the Earths crust
