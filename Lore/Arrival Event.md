#arrival-event #time-core

# Cause
The arrival event was caused by a meteor cloud passing through the solar system and scattering along the solar system, including on Earth.
# Cloud
The cloud that caused the arrival event was detected very shortly before the first arrival of meteor showers on Earth.
The origins of this cloud are unknown, but it has been theorized that a rogue dwarf planet already heading towards us would somehow have "shattered" without explosive force (possibly due to tidal forces), leaving all its fragments moving towards us with nearly the same trajectory as before the shattering. The size of these fragments would range from tens of kilometers to ones the size of a grain of sand, with the average having a volume of around 5 m<sup>3</sup>.
# Effects
## Solar System
While passing through the solar system, the cloud got torn apart by various gravitational forces, resulting in them being scattered throughout the solar system, with some of them crashing into planets and moons, others being caught into orbits around the sun, planets or moons, and the majority simply being flung out, in a plethora of different directions.

## Earth
When the fragments of the cloud first started to arrive on earth, nothing much happened at first. The asteroids were not that big, and most of them would vaporize before ever touching the earth. Those that were large enough to crash were of course investigated. The [[Time Cores]] were discovered while analyzing fragments from the crash. The discovery of the Time Cores quickly led to the closing off of the site to the general public, and the eventual founding of [[Looper]].


# random notes:
First reports of Cores on earth happened after an anomalous meteor shower, with many meteors in this meteor cloud containing Cores. They were discovered accidentally when researching the nature of this meteor shower.


"The arrival event" is the name given to the moment that a meteor "cloud" passed through the solar system. The origins of this meteor cloud are unknown, but it has been theorized that a very small exoplanet might have somehow fallen apart without exploding, leading to this group of meteorites all heading in exactly the same direction. Due to gravitational forces when entering the solar system, meteors were flung nearly everywhere, many crashing into planets some getting caught in the Kuiper Belt and even fewer escaping the Sun's sphere of influence.
