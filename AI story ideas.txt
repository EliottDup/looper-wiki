Can you help me finish the story for my game?
what i have currently is:
"You work for Looper Inc., they recieve a message from the future saying that {something bad} is going to happen. so they decide to try to make robots that can go back in time to escape this fate. and against your will, your brain gets put into one of these robots and they do extensive testing on you. In the end, you manage to go back in time to the time that they kidnapped you and save your younger self. due to time paradoxes, you get erased from reality and your younger self never gets to know what actually happened."
I have put unsure information in curly brackets {like this}, could you help fill in these blanks and give me overall feedback on the story?

-------------------------------------------

Sure, I'd be happy to help with your story. Here's a potential way to fill in the blanks and add to the story:

You work for Looper Inc., a company that specializes in time travel technology. One day, they receive a message from the future warning them that a catastrophic event is about to occur. In order to escape this fate, Looper Inc. decides to create a team of robots that can go back in time and prevent the disaster from happening.

Against your will, your brain is chosen to be put into one of these robots. The scientists at Looper Inc. conduct extensive testing on you, pushing you to your limits to see if you can withstand the stresses of time travel. Despite the challenges, you manage to successfully navigate through time.

After several time jumps, you find yourself in the past, at the moment that your younger self is kidnapped by the scientists at Looper Inc. You use your knowledge of the future to save your younger self and prevent them from being put through the same ordeal that you went through.

But as a result of your actions, you create a time paradox. Your younger self never experiences the events that led to you going back in time, and as a result, you cease to exist in the present. In the end, you are erased from reality, but your younger self is safe.

Overall, the story has potential, but it could benefit from more details and character development. It's not clear why the scientists at Looper Inc. decide to kidnap your younger self, or why they are motivated to create the team of robots in the first place. Additionally, it's not clear how your younger self is able to survive without your intervention. These are just some ideas to consider as you continue to develop your story.

-------------------------------------------

Looper inc. wanted to make the robots because the human body is not fit for time travel, but the human mind can be if it is strong enough, and your brain was one of the strongerst at Looper Inc.
they wanted to create the robots so that they could go back in time to be able to understand why this catastrophic event will happen and how to prevent it. Is this better?

--------------------------------------------

Yes, that adds more context and motivation to the story. It makes sense that Looper Inc. would want to create robots with human brains that are strong enough to withstand the stresses of time travel in order to prevent the catastrophic event from occurring. It also gives a reason for why your brain was chosen to be put into one of the robots. However, it's still not clear why the scientists at Looper Inc. would kidnap your younger self in order to carry out their experiments. Maybe you could explain that in more detail to add to the story.
