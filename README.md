# What is this?
This is probably way too big of a project for me to undertake, but here I am, writing out all of this.
Looper Inc. started as an idea for a game, and after trying to make the game **twice**, and not really getting close to something that I like, I realized that I needed to write down what I wanted to make first instead of jumping in without any Idea of what I want. So I started trying to make a game design document, and doing this I realized that I wanted to know more about this world before getting started. Soooo, I'm now writing some sort of *wiki*, to help me write everything down in an orderly fashion.

Also, check out [[INFO]], there's a bit more backstory into what this is in there.
