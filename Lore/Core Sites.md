Core Sites is the name given to locations where [[Time Cores]] can be found, usually these are crash sites from the [[Arrival Event]], with one notable exception, the Aleutian Site, located near the deeper regions of the Aleutian trench. This site appears to have existed for many thousands of years, and also is the largest site Looper has been able to detect, being multiple orders of magnitudes larger than all other Sites. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include an earlier arrival event, much more concentrated to the one that brought Looper forth.
