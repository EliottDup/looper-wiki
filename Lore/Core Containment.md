#core-containement
The only known way to Stabilize a core is by the use of a Temporal Stabilizer. These allow for complete control of a Core's power. But there is an alternative: Core Containers.
# Temporal Stabilizers
Temporal Stabilizers (TS for short) are experimental machines that can "trap" a Time Core in a 3d slice, allowing its power to be harnessed by creating a 4d field that constrains any time core that enters it to its (the TS) 3d slice.

While Temporal Stabilizers are very large and cumbersome to work with, they allow for complete control of the Core's power. Allowing Looper to use them to freely accelerate/decelerate through time and space in any direction. The size constraint only makes them them suitable for large static constructions like [[Interdimensional Stations]] ( #wip ). 

# Core Containers
These small Containers are slightly thicker than a regular pen, but comparable in length. Holding the Time Core in the center, these small contraptions are much more constrained in their abilities. Depending on the Potency of the Core, they allow for shorter changes in the passage of time, usually ranging from months to years with the average Core, with some of the strongest Cores however, this can be extended to millennia, with the weakest, reduced to seconds. 

These Containers however are still limited in what they can achieve, able to do the simplest of tasks like inverting or speeding up the user's time frame (note that the term *user* refers here to whatever machine it powers).
