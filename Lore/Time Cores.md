# Time Cores
This strange artifact found from a [[#Source|Source]] #wip does not travel through time linearly, arising interest from an unknown organization later renamed to [[Looper]].

## Unstable Cores
Unstable Time Cores are found layered with ultra-heavy metals nearly frozen in time, making extracting these cores almost impossible to extract.

These Time Cores slowly build up heavy metals around them, seemingly to protect them from the outside. These layers build up through nuclear fusion, anytime the core hits a particle, this particle is fused into the outer layer. There is a small chance that a particle instead "sticks" to the outer layer, thus beginning the construction of yet another layer. These layers do not grow beyond a certain point, as the further they get from the core, the less they are slowed, which at a certain point allowing for the decay to be equal to the amount of particles amassed, creating an equilibrium.

Since these metals are nearly frozen in time, any energy transferred to them from our reference frame accumulates very fast from their reference frame. Them being nearly frozen in time also means that they decay over nearly infinite periods of time, and makes them impenetrable to all known technology.

The reason these Cores make themselves and their "shields" move slowly through time is because they themselves are constantly moving through the 4th dimension. And like moving close to the speed of light makes you travel slower through time, moving very close to light speed in the 4th dimension would slow down its time.

These cores are also not simply "moving", but more "vibrating" in the 4th dimension, making them stay near our 3d slice, not moving more than multiple plank lengths from their original position.
This implies that there can also be Cores just outside of our 3d slice, which pushes Looper to invest in 4 dimensional "nudging" of Cores into our slice to retrieve more of them from sources. Since the outer shield is also a hypersphere, it is also possible for a Core to be out of our reach, but its shield to be visible. 
## Stable Cores
Cores are stabilized by trapping them in our 3d slice using a [[#Temporal Stabilizers|Temporal Stabilizer]] to energize the Core. Doing this locks it into our 3d slice, stopping its 4d movement and forcing it to travel through time regularly, also instantly breaking down their shields, as the ultra-heavy elements start to decay at normal rates, in turn revealing the Core.

## Core Potency
Some Cores are more powerful than others, requiring more energy to constrain but less to be guided in the required direction.

Cores of higher Potency are always heavier than their less Potent counterparts. However the difference in mass is nearly negligible, even over immense Potency differences. For example, the most Potent Core found can work for thousands of years uninterrupted, and the least Potent Core could only sustain "warping" for at most close to a millisecond, with their mass differing by only around 0,05%.

## Life Cycle
While it is unknown how Cores are formed, understanding their "life cycle" can help us understand their birth.
While we have no Idea how Cores came to be, there is strong evidence for them having the ability to split or "Separate" into smaller Cores with less Potency, but preserving velocity and direction. The reason that this is believes is that tighter clusters of Cores have been observed to have very similar velocity and movement, this has been observed on every Core Site found.

There is currently no evidence of an inverse action to Separation. (Note that Separation has not yet been confirmed and only has strong evidence for it)

### Theories
There are multiple theories on Cores and their origins, with the most prominent ones listed below. None of these have been either proven or disproven.

#### Descendance
This suggests that Cores are able to Separate, but nothing else. Meaning that all Cores must either come from one or multiple "Original Core(s)". These Original Cores would have unimaginable Potencies. 
If this is the case, the Cores that arrived on Earth are likely from the same Original, as their vibration vectors all point toward the same general direction. (Note: This might also be due to an unknown Alignment phenomenon that might have occurred a long time ago)
Whether there would have been only one or multiple Originals is unknown.

#### Full Cycle
This theory suggests that cores can both Separate and Assimilate, theorizing that Cores are the most stable at the sizes that have been found on Earth. While this no longer necessitates any Original Cores, it allows for the possibility that an Original was created and then broke down into the smaller parts we have on Earth.

#### The Passage
This theory, while seemingly very outlandish, has yet to be be disproven and is taken seriously by the physicists at Looper. Building upon the idea of both the Big Bang and the Big Crunch. Theorizing that Time Cores can pass through the Big Crunch and survive the Big Bang, essentially traversing to a new universe, and split while doing so. The implications of this would be that many universes ago, the Originals were created/formed, and have persisted/endured through many entire universes, their beginning, and their ends.
# Core Containment
The only known way to Stabilize a core is by the use of a Temporal Stabilizer. These allow for complete control of a Core's power. But there is an alternative: Core Containers.
## Temporal Stabilizers
Temporal Stabilizers (TS for short) are experimental machines that can "trap" a Time Core in a 3d slice, allowing its power to be harnessed by creating a 4d field that constrains any time core that enters it to its (the TS) 3d slice.

While Temporal Stabilizers are very large and cumbersome to work with, they allow for complete control of the Core's power. Allowing Looper to use them to freely accelerate/decelerate through time and space in any direction. The size constraint only makes them them suitable for large static constructions like Interdimensional Stations ( #wip ). 

## Core Containers
These small Containers are slightly thicker than a regular pen, but comparable in length. Holding the Time Core in the center, these small contraptions are much more constrained in their abilities. Depending on the Potency of the Core, they allow for shorter changes in the passage of time, usually ranging from months to years with the average Core, with some of the strongest Cores however, this can be extended to millennia, with the weakest, reduced to seconds. 

These Containers however are still limited in what they can achieve, able to do the simplest of tasks like inverting or speeding up the user's time frame (note that the term *user* refers here to whatever machine it powers).
