#aleutian-site
Core Sites is the name given to locations where [[Time Cores]] can be found, usually these are crash sites from the [[Arrival Event]], with one notable exception, the Aleutian Site, located near the deeper regions of the Aleutian trench. This site appears to have existed for many thousands of years, and also is the largest site [[Looper]] has been able to detect, being multiple orders of magnitudes larger than all other Sites. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include an earlier arrival event, much more concentrated to the one that happened lately

# Notable Sites
## Aleutian Site
The Aleutian Site is the largest of all the sites, discovered by Looper and kept secret. It was discovered shortly before Looper went rogue. It is the largest site known on the planet, detected by coincidence as Looper's satellite passed over it. It is located deep under water in the Aleutian Trench, spread out over hundreds of kilometers, with Cores found even in the walls of the trench, indicating that this site has existed since before the trench was created.
The current theory on the existence of the Aleutian Site is that a large meteor carrying multiple massive Cores approached earth, and shattered shortly after entering the atmosphere sending fragments along its trajectory, some of which contained these massive Cores. These cores then broke down and split over time (see [[Time Cores#Life Cycle]]), creating multiple sites which kept growing, eventually joining them up into an otherwise impossibly large site.

## Chicxulub Site
Named after the ancient meteor, this site was located nearly exactly where the former landed. This is merely a coincidence though, as it was formed by a meteor from the [[Arrival Event]]. It is however one of the largest sites formed by the arrival event. 

## \[\[LOCATION]] Cluster
#wip name wip, location not yet determined

This collection of sites, located relatively closely to each other (all within a radius of 20 km of their center), was created by the largest meteor of the arrival event shattering shortly before crashing, creating a collection of about 10 smaller sites very closely to each other. The \[\[LOCATION]] Cluster would have been the largest site had it not shattered, no value has been lost however, any potency this meteor had was simply split over the multiple sites.
