# Founding

Looper was an international government-founded operation to research the [[Time Cores]], founded shortly after the [[Arrival Event]]. Several countries made their own programs to research the Time Cores, but Looper was the biggest of them all.

# Going Rogue
The company however, shortly before the first usable results, moved every Time Core they controlled to an unknown location and cut all contacts. Eliminating or buying off anyone who knew about them. They also secretly took control of multiple large corporations and suppliers for nearly unlimited funding and materials.

Shortly after Looper went rogue, other teams started disappearing, along with all their research, samples and [[Core Sites]].
With all known Core Sites "cleaned up", Looper invested heavily into Core Site Location, allowing them to Locate all Core Sites on Earth. Along with the largest one, near the Tonga Trench, at a depth of nearly 9000 meters.
