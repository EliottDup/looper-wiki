#aleutian-site
Core Sites is the name given to locations where [[Time Cores]] can be found, usually these are crash sites from the [[Arrival Event]], with one notable exception, the Aleutian Site, located near the deeper regions of the Aleutian trench. This site appears to have existed for many thousands of years, and also is the largest site Looper has been able to detect, being multiple orders of magnitudes larger than all other Sites. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include an earlier arrival event, much more concentrated to the one that brought Looper forth.

## Aleutian Site

## Chicxulub Site
Named after the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, this site was located nearly exactly where the former landed. This is merely a coincidence though, as it was formed by a meteor from the [[Arrival Event]]. It is however one of the largest sites formed by the arrival event. 

## \[\[LOCATION]] Cluster
This collection of sites, located relatively closely to each other (all within a radius of 20 km of their center), was created by the largest meteor of the arrival event shattering shortly before crashing, creating a collection of about 10 smaller sites very closely to each other. The \[\[LOCATION]] Cluster would have been the largest site had it not shattered, no value has been lost however, any potency this meteor had was simply split over the multiple sites.
